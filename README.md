# Rundown:
This script attempts to simply approximate the famous infinite monkey theorum and put it within context of internet passwords. 
Given that there are 95 valid key inputs on a keyboard, the total number of possible combinations the monkey could ever type is **95^n**, such that n is the length of the inputted password.
Statistically, random guesses would eventually be correct about halfway through all possible tries on average, so this number is divided by 2, giving us our EXPECTED # of guesses.
Approximate time is calculated using the user's input of guesses per second. 
Depending on how long it would theoretically, a little comment is written below the running simulation

Thanks for checking out my project! This was my first complete web-dev project I've done outside of school..
